## Editor's note

This version of *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* was adapted from *The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass*. The [Guttenberg file](http://www.gutenberg.org/) does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and therefore should not be taken too seriously as an edition. I use the text mostly to show a few affordances of using Ed for long form narrative. This page, for example, showcases a different sidebar than the rest of our sample site, with a table of content of the novel generated out of metadata in the source file. In addition, reading morsels of the novel on your different devices can give you a sense of the experience of reading prose using Ed, and shows you an example of the optional sidebar with a table of contents. A few other features of this page are described in more detail in the [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/).

To anyone returning from Europe the most striking thing about America is the complete ignorance obtaining here about the war. Everywhere in Europe people not only know about the war but frankly discuss every phase of it. XX Over here we have assumed the naive attitude that truth is treason. At the same time we are all aware that eventaully we must all face the situation - even if we lose. 

Now I am not a Pro-German or a pro anything. I believe in violence so I am surely not a Pacifist. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX I love French people and the French manner of living and I find the Germans and the Belgians and all similar XXXXX folk very unattractive. That is all I have to say for XXXXX my personal feelings in this matter. 

For the last two months I have travelled all over France and have talked to all kinds of people about this war. I have been at army headquarters, at the aviation schools, in munition factories, through the devastated region, in the trenches, in air raids, in a sub-marine battle. I have been with intellectuals, militarists, anti-militarists, workers, capitilists, civilians and soldiers. I believe I can very truthfully report XXXXXXXXXXXX conditions. XXXXXXXXXX and opinions. 

Before I went Europe I used often {to} hear the remark "France is bled white". It was a vague, poetic term. It fell glibly from the lips of the society bud and the social service worker as well as the politician. {No nation can comprehend} what it is to be bled white except the nation that has been bled. XXXXX Certainly XXXXXX the United States does not know what it means, or England, XXX or for that matter, Germany. If all our women were in mouring and all X our youth had been slaughtered {and  and hideous cripples hobbled about the streets,} and we were tired and desperate and bewildered I suppose we also could understand. {France has known for a long time and Serbia and Poland have known.}
