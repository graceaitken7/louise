## Editor's note

This version of *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass* was adapted from *The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass*. The [Guttenberg file](http://www.gutenberg.org/) does not tell us which witness was used in making their digital edition. The edition below is only a slightly modified version of the Guttenberg text, and therefore should not be taken too seriously as an edition. I use the text mostly to show a few affordances of using Ed for long form narrative. This page, for example, showcases a different sidebar than the rest of our sample site, with a table of content of the novel generated out of metadata in the source file. In addition, reading morsels of the novel on your different devices can give you a sense of the experience of reading prose using Ed, and shows you an example of the optional sidebar with a table of contents. A few other features of this page are described in more detail in the [Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/).
